====================

Writes Mantis events (new issues/new notes) to the Irc it (ii) pipe.

## Instructions: Requirements

- MantisBT Core 1.2.14 (it is possible this plug-in works in older versions, but I could not test this)
- A running instance of [ii 1.7](http://tools.suckless.org/ii/)

## Todo

- Configuration page for path/server/channel
- Adding more [Mantis events](http://www.mantisbt.org/docs/master-1.2.x/en/developers.html#DEV.EVENTREF) and select the ones you want to use via the configuration page
- Configuration: Message templates per Mantis event
